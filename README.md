Question 4: Online Food Ordering System
Develop a comprehensive online food ordering platform that enables users to browse restaurants, place orders,
and track deliveries seamlessly. The system should support real-time tracking, secure payments, and efficient
restaurant management to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. It should include as many features
as possible say for customer side, the following:
Users can explore nearby restaurants, view menus, filter by cuisine, pricing, or ratings, and check availability. AI-
driven suggestions based on past orders, user preferences, and trending dishes.
Users receive live updates on order status: Order Confirmed → Being Prepared → Out for Delivery → Delivered.
Multiple payment options including credit/debit cards, UPI, e-wallets, and cash on delivery (COD). Secure payment.
Users can earn rewards, redeem promo codes, and avail of membership benefits. Should show Order History &
Reordering – Saves past orders for quick reordering.
Similarly for Restaurants, delivery personnel etc….useful features can be added.
The entire system has to be designed around OOP using Java
• Minimum 6 classes are required to accommodate all the requirements specified in the design problem.
Additionally, it should include the following:
(I) Overloaded methods (minimum 2)
(II) Overloaded constructors (minimum 2)
(III) Vararg overloading (minimum 2)
(IV) Nested classes (static or nonstatic, atleast 1, this is a part of I above)
(V) Abstract class (minimum 1)
(VI) Interface (minimum 1, it can be nested interface or single level or multiple inheritance)
(VII) Hierarchical Inheritance (atleast 1)
(VIII) Multiple Inheritance (atleast 1, this should be in addition to VI above)
(IX) Wrappers
(X) Package
(XI) Exception handling (atleast two cases)
(XII) I/O: File Handling, scanner class etc. (atleast one from each of these)
(XIII) Multithreading (by either Implementing the Runnable interface or extending the thread class)
These are the minimum requirements, but you have the freedom to incorporate a greater number of each as
needed.
Note: The names of variables, methods and classes should be lexically rational and should be accompanied with
their description in the comments alongside. Your overall code will be something similar to the codes that you wrote
in most of your lab hours. It goes without saying that the code should be well indented and should compile and run
error free. However, do remember that a non-running code is better than a plagiarized one, and hence the latter
one will be penalised heavily if it exceeds 10-15% (may result in recession of this component).
• Draw the UML diagram for the above system
Your submission folder should include:
(1) Word doc which explains your project thoroughly along with the UML diagram.
(2) The actual UML diagram
(3) Code appended to the above word doc.
(4) .java files
(5) PPT (you can also show at the time of presentation directly)
(6) Rubrics of the usage of all of the above (I to XIII) . Make a table and list the above components and
mention how many have you used in each of the category.
